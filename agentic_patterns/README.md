# My Agentic Patterns Implementation

This is my personal implementation of the 4 core agentic patterns, built from scratch to deeply understand how AI agents work.

## Patterns Implemented

- [ ] **Reflection Pattern** - Iterative self-improvement through critique
- [ ] **Tool Pattern** - External function calling capabilities
- [ ] **Planning Pattern (ReAct)** - Reasoning and acting in loops
- [ ] **Multi-Agent Pattern** - Collaborative agent orchestration

## Project Structure

```
src/agentic_patterns/     # Core library code
examples/                 # Usage examples for each pattern
```

## Setup

1. Create a `.env` file with your API key:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Learning Journey

This project is built pattern-by-pattern, understanding each design decision from first principles.
